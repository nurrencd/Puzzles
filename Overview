DEAD PROJECT:
I got burnt out on the real game this puzzle was based off of, so naturally I lost interest in the project. 

This repository is a collection of my implementation of puzzle games

1) Carpentry in Puzzle Pirates
-- Fill holes with 12 possible pentominoes, allowing rotation / flipping
-- emphasis on speed and preccision
